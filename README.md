# brainsapp-lib
The brainsapp lib is used to give every publisher from the brainsapp community the possibility to use our ad system.

Just simply add the following tags to your page if you want to enable them:

```html
<span class=“_ba_banner”></span> 
```
for a banner ad on your page


```html
<span class=“_ba_modal”></span> 
```
for a modal ad on your page (when the users scrolls over this point the modal will open)

```html
<span class=“_ba_popup”></span>
```
 for a popup ad on your page (when the users scrolls over this point the popup will be triggered)

In the html file you will see a demo implementation.
